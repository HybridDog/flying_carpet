Minetest mod: Flying Carpet
===========================
by Wuzzy

Version: 0.3.0

Introduction
------------
Quickly explore the vast terrain with the magical flying carpet. But be careful, you need to be a bit skilled to be able to fly it, and being careless may lead to damage or even death.

The carpet flies fast horizontally, but very slowly is it able to move vertically. It constantly reduces your mana resources, you can't use it forever (note: only if Mana mod is installed).

How to use
----------
There is no crafting recipe yet. Use the itemstring “flying_carpet:carpet” for now.

Look to the desired initial flight direction and place the carpet on any flat surface, make sure it has enough space. Then rightclick it to depart.
Flying the carpet is a bit tricky, because it flies fast, you can't fully brake and the turning speed is rather low. Be careful not to crash into the landscape!

If the carpet is under a certain critcal speed, it loses its magic and just drops on the ground.
This also happens if you crash into the landscape!
If you crash while being fast, you may also take damage. There is also fall damage, but with the carpet it is greatly reduced compared to a “normal” drop.
Your carpet will also stop working if your mana resources are depleted (only if Mana mod is installed and active).
When your carpet stopped working, you have to collect the carpet (punch it) and place it again.

If you fly directly down onto solid ground, your flying carpet will come to a halt quickly.

Your carpet can not fly into liquids from above, but it can fly into them from the side or even below. But be careful, being submerged in a liquid may slow you down a lot!

Your carpet will disintegrate and be lost forever if it stands still and has no user for 1 minute.
